### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I learnt new things while doing this project.I was able to know how successfully add icons to my work,and how to use preffered fonts for my work. I could properly position the elements as well.




### Continued development

I'm definitely going to learn more on positioning and the use of using hsl index for colors is also what I'm focusing on, for further projects.
