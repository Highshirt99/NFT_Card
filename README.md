## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for interactive elements. 



Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I learnt new things while doing this project.I was able to know how successfully add icons to my work,and how to use preffered fonts for my work. I could properly position the elements as well.




### Continued development

I'm definitely going to learn more on positioning and the use of using hsl index for colors is also what I'm focusing on, for further projects.
